1.4 - GStreamer Preset Management
    Removed the flat-file preset system, and 
    replaced it with presets managed by the 
    Preset system provided by GStreamer.

    Thanks to Stefan Kost for telling me about
    the GStreamer presets.

1.3 - Presets!
    Added flat-file based preset management,
    with the ability to save and delete presets
    in the program on-the-fly.
