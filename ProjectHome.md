The plugin acts as an equalizer system for the music player Rhythmbox for Linux.  Currently, it has 10 channels and ties directly into the GStreamer framework that feeds the IO for Rhythmbox.

## Installation instructions: ##

Open a terminal, and execute this command:
`tar -xvzf rbeq-1.4.tar.gz -C ~/.gnome2`

Please remove any previously installed versions of rbeq before attempting a new installation.

Open rhythmbox, and go to Edit -> Plugins, and select "Rhythmbox Equalizer."

If you're on Fedora 13, just run a `yum install rhythmbox-equalizer`.
